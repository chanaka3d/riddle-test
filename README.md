# riddle-test

I sovled this riddle by initially setting the Acccpt content type header in the request to get the response in JSON. But getting this answer, I used chatGPT.

Sedondly realized the response is running in a loop. So created a bash script. For this also I didn't do this from the scratch. Got help from ChatGPT but had to make some tweeks in the bash code in order to get it working.
